This is my first post to thegrid! I'll be moving the content from my previous blog over here over the next few days. Looking forward to seeing how it turns out. Having an AI handle the design is quite the prospect. The interface it really interesting. Threw in my old logo though.. going to have to change that out maybe. I've also included a picture of a lake near Sudbury, Ontario and some food, because I'm assuming I'll need to feed the AI more information to better design the site. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4bd1cc88-759c-434e-8f64-e58de655b6dc.png)
